# Sample projects for my presentation "Actors in .NET"

The solution contains sample C# projects generated with the help of AI (Google Gemini CLI) with the implementation of S3 file upload using the following actor model frameworks:
- Akka.NET
- Microsoft Orleans
- ProtoActor

I had to make some changes to the AI-generated code to make it use latest .NET framework and libraries and in case of Microsoft Orleans to make it compile.
